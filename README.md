# DataAnalyst_COMERCIAL
I have been a commercial analyst for a while, and I've developed some controls and skills that are pretty useful for me. I intend to showcase some of these here with a case I constructed based on a dataset I obtained from Kaggle.

## AUTOR EXPERIENCE - MATHEUS CORDEIRO SALLES

I started working in a supply company which sells and delivers beer.
As the main analyst in the company, my role is to handle data and generate reports for both operations and management. I've grown significantly as an analyst while creating dashboards using Excel and Qlik Sense, but the most powerful tool I've encountered is Python. Regardless of the size of the data I work with, Python consistently surpasses other tools I've tried.
Automating reports is a very welcome idea. I used this as the basis for implementing Python in my job.

## PROJECT

The aim here is to construct a comprehensive SQL database containing supply information and utilize this data to generate reports.
