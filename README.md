# DataAnalyst_COMERCIAL
I have been a commercial analyst for a while, and I've developed some controls and skills that are pretty useful for me. I intend to showcase some of these here with a case I constructed based on a dataset I obtained from Kaggle.

## PROJECT

The aim here is to construct a comprehensive SQL database containing supply information and utilize this data to generate reports. Here I expect to show some skills in ETL using pandas library and SQLite to craft a simple database.

### Details

Tables created are basic in a commercial area, as the following:

    -PRODUCTS       -register of every product with his properties 
    -PRICE          -a reference table to save every price listed 
    -CLIENTS        -the register of every client
    -SALESMAN       -basic register of the salesforce team
    -ORDERS MAIN    -the main orders table
    -ORDERS ITEM    -the item orders table

I know a sales control sistem is way more complex than it, but my target is not to create a new ERP, I only need a minimum complexity to show ETL skills and some SQL SELECT comands.
